Accept Web3 payments, supporting various cryptocurrency tokens, blockchains and wallets, with the UnusPay Payments extension for WooCommerce.

== Source Code ==

The plugin includes minified assets in the /assets/js folder.

[widgets](https://github.com/unuspay/widgets)

== Public REST API Endpoints ==

This plugin registers several public REST API endpoints under the `/wp-json/unuspay/wc/` namespace. These endpoints are intentionally exposed without authentication (`__return_true`) for integration with the UnusPay payment platform. They are safe for public use and designed for communication between the WooCommerce store and UnusPay.

- `/wp-json/unuspay/wc/checkouts/{id}`  
  Used by the user to create a UnusPay order and initiate the payment process.

- `/wp-json/unuspay/wc/track`  
  Used by the user to submit payment results to UnusPay for tracking the payment status.

- `/wp-json/unuspay/wc/release`  
  Used by the user to query the payment status from UnusPay to check whether the transaction has been verified.

- `/wp-json/unuspay/wc/validate`  
  Called by UnusPay to send a notification after the transaction has been successfully verified.

These endpoints are required for the payment workflow and are meant to be accessible from external clients and the UnusPay server. If needed, additional security mechanisms such as token validation can be implemented on the server side.

   - **Privacy Policies of common providers**:  
     - MetaMask: https://consensys.net/privacy-policy/  
     - WalletConnect: https://walletconnect.com/privacy-policy/

   - **Note**: This API is included as a feature of our plugin to provide token logos dynamically during the payment process.
      When users initiate a payment and select a token, the plugin fetches the token logo from this API and displays it in the interface.
      Our payment system supports thousands of tokens across multiple blockchains.
         It is not feasible to bundle all logos inside the plugin because:
         The plugin size would become extremely large
         Updating token logos would require frequent plugin releases
         Scalability would be limited as new tokens appear

### 1. Worldcoin Username API
This service is provided by Worldcoin (world.org) and is used to query usernames associated with wallet addresses, likely for displaying user-friendly identifiers in your plugin's widgets or transaction views.

- Data sent: Wallet addresses (e.g., an array of addresses like [t] in the POST body).
- When: Every time the plugin fetches username data, such as during widget loading or when processing a specific address.
- Terms of Service: https://world.org/legal/user-terms-and-conditions
- Privacy Policy: https://world.org/legal/privacy-notice

### 2. Gnosis Safe Transaction Service API
This service is provided by Gnosis (gnosis.io / safe.global) and is used to retrieve transaction history and details for multisig safes, such as all transactions for a safe or specific multisig transaction data.

- Data sent: Safe addresses, transaction IDs, and related identifiers (e.g., via URL paths like /safes/{address}/all-transactions/ or /multisig-transactions/{tx_id}/).
- When: When the plugin needs to display or process transaction data for a Gnosis Safe, such as in widget updates or on-demand queries.

### 4. Solana RPC API
This service is provided by Solana (solana.com) and consists of public RPC endpoints for interacting with the Solana blockchain, such as querying blockchain data or submitting transactions.

- When: Whenever the plugin interacts with the Solana network, such as during chain detection, transaction processing, or widget initialization.
- Terms of Service: https://solana.com/tos

### Additional Notes
- The plugin only sends data necessary for the intended functionality (e.g., addresses, IDs) and does not share unrelated user data unless specified otherwise in the code.
